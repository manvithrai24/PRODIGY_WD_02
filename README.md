⏱️ Update on My Web Development Internship: Stopwatch App Completed! ⏱️

I'm thrilled to share that I've successfully completed a project as part of my Web Development Internship at Prodigy InfoTech, where I developed a **Stopwatch Application**! 💻⏲️

This project has been an enriching experience, enabling me to:
🔸 Implement responsive design for seamless usability across devices.
🔸 Use JavaScript to handle start, stop, and reset functionalities.
🔸 Enhance my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for real-time web interactions.


A heartfelt thanks to **Prodigy InfoTech** for their continuous support and guidance. I’m eager to take on more challenges and further my skills in web development!
